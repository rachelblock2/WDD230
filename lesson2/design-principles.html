            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3><span>Adobe</span></h3>
            <p class="website_link"><a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a></p>
            <img src="images/Adobe.jpg" alt="Adobe Screenshot" />
            <p>Adobe's website purpose is to bring customers in to buy or at least 
            try their products, which are computer applications that help designers 
            in multiple career fields.</p>
            <p>Looking at their mobile website, they have created a great example of 
            Hick's Law. The landing page is very simple, with the menu and search
            minimized with the focus on the Creative Cloud trial offer. The color
            of the advertisement stands out without being too loud or annoying.</p>

            <h2>Contrast<br></h2>
            <h3><span>IKEA</span></h3>
            <p class="website_link"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/?ref=gwp-start">IKEA</a></p>
            <img src="images/IKEA.jpg" alt="Adobe Screenshot" />
            <p>While IKEA's logo is dark blue and yellow, their website does not focus 
            on that color. Instead, white, black and various shades of gray are used, with 
            focus on the bright, colorful pictures of their products.</p>
            <p>This provides contrast to the webpage. It allows for the viewer's
            eye to be drawn to the products rather than the webpage itself. It
            also alludes to minimalistic, Scandanvian style that IKEA uses in
            their products.</p>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3><span>USPS</span></h3>
            <p class="website_link"><a href="https://www.usps.com/">USPS</a></p>
            <img src="images/USPS.jpg" alt="Adobe Screenshot" />
            <p>USPS has done well with using the rule of thirds on their mobile pages.
            The buttons below the field to enter a tracking number are aligned in a way
            that is pleasing.</p>
            <p>This allows for a user on a mobile device to have a more pleasant user
            experience. The buttons are large, orderly, and given icons to quickly understand an
            option a user may want to take.</p>
